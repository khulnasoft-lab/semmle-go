## 0.0.7

### Deprecated APIs

* The `semmle/go-upgrades` Semmle pack has been removed. All database upgrade scripts have been merged into the `semmle/go-all` Semmle pack.

### Bug Fixes

* `Function`'s predicate `getACall` now returns more results in some situations. It now always returns callers that may call a method indirectly via an interface method that it implements. Previously this only happened if the method was in the source code being analysed.
